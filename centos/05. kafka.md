# Kafka v2.1.x

for more guide

## Requirements
* os: Linux CentOS v7
* sudoer user

	
## Installation
Logged in as your non-root sudo user, create a user called kafka with the useradd command:
```bash
$ sudo useradd kafka -m
$ # type and re-type kafka when prompt user password
$ sudo passwd kafka
$ sudo usermod -aG wheel kafka
```

Let's download and extract the Kafka binaries into dedicated folders in our kafka user's home directory.
```bash
$ su -l kafka
$ mkdir ~/Downloads
$ curl "https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.1.0/kafka_2.12-2.1.0.tgz" -o ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz
$ mkdir ~/kafka && cd ~/kafka
$ tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz --strip 1
```

Configuring the Kafka Server
```bash
$ vi ~/kafka/config/server.properties
```

Append this text below `end of line`
```text
delete.topic.enable = true
```

Creating Systemd Unit Files and Starting the Kafka Server
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/zookeeper.service
```

Paste this text:
```text
[Unit]
Requires=network.target remote-fs.target
After=network.target remote-fs.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=kafka
ExecStart=/home/kafka/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh /home/kafka/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties
ExecStop=/home/kafka/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh
Restart=on-abnormal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Next, create the systemd service file for kafka:
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/kafka.service
```

Paste this text:
```text
[Unit]
Requires=zookeeper.service
After=zookeeper.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=kafka
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh /home/kafka/kafka/config/server.properties > /home/kafka/kafka/kafka.log 2>&1'
ExecStop=/home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
Restart=on-abnormal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now that the units have been defined, start Kafka with the following command:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl start kafka
$ # To ensure that the server has started successfully, check the journal logs
$ journalctl -u kafka
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash 
Feb 06 18:38:59 kafka-centos systemd[1]: Started kafka.service.
```

You now have a Kafka server listening on port 9092.
While we have started the kafka service, if we were to reboot our server, it would not be started automatically. 
To enable kafka on server boot, run:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable kafka
```

Restricting the Kafka User
Now that all of the installations are done, you can remove the kafka user's admin privileges. Before you do so, log out and log back in as any other non-root sudo user. If you are still running the same shell session you started this tutorial with, simply type exit.

Remove the kafka user from the sudo group:
```bash
$ sudo gpasswd -d kafka wheel
```

To further improve your Kafka server's security, lock the kafka user's password using the passwd command. This makes sure that nobody can directly log into the server using this account:
```bash
$ sudo passwd kafka -l
```

At this point, only root or a sudo user can log in as kafka by typing in the following command:
```bash
$ sudo su - kafka
```

In the future, if you want to unlock it, use passwd with the -u option:
```bash
$ sudo passwd kafka -u
```

You have now successfully restricted the kafka user's admin privileges, then exit the session
```bash
$ exit
```

## Test
First, create a topic named `test` by typing:
```bash
/home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
```

You can create a producer from the command line using the kafka-console-producer.sh script. 
It expects the Kafka server's hostname, port, and a topic name as arguments.
Publish the string "Hello, World" to the `test` topic by typing:
```bash
$ echo "Hello, World" | /home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test > /dev/null
```
Next, you can create a Kafka consumer using the kafka-console-consumer.sh script. 
It expects the ZooKeeper server's hostname and port, along with a topic name as arguments.
The following command consumes messages from `test`. 
Note the use of the --from-beginning flag, which allows the consumption of messages that were 
published before the consumer was started:
```bash
$ /home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
```

If there are no configuration issues, you should see Hello, World in your terminal:
```text
Hello, World
```
